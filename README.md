# Ticket-System-Queue

Ticket System for clinic registration counter using Queue STL implementation. 

General requirements are as follows:
1. When a patient comes in, the operator will generate queue number and give it to the patient (assume printing is available). Program will record the queue number and the patient
   name generated.
3. Patients have to wait until their numbers are called. When a patient is served, the patient queue number will be removed from the queue.
4. Using the program, staff can:
   • Get the total number of waiting patients in queue.
   • Display all patients in queue.
   • Serve a patient – this will show the queue number to be served and update the queue list.
   • Exit the program.
